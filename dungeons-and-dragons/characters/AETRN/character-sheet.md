## Backstory
Once, AETRN was a devoted bodyguard, sworn to protect a powerful noble. His loyalty was unwavering, and he served with dedication. However, his world was shattered when he began hearing sinister whispers that seemed to emanate from the shadows themselves.
At first, he tried to ignore the whispers, dismissing them as figments of his imagination. But they grew louder and more insistent, gradually driving him to the brink of madness. He struggled to resist their commands, but their influence was too strong, clouding his mind and twisting his thoughts.
The noble was a cruel and tyrannical ruler, exploiting and torturing his own people for personal gain.
One fateful night, while on duty, the whispers reached a fever pitch, commanding AETRN to eliminate the noble and stop his tyranny. Desperate to silence the voices, he obeyed, unleashing a torrent of violence that ended in the death of the noble he had sworn to protect.

Haunted by guilt and consumed by remorse, he fled into the wilderness, seeking solace and redemption. But the whispers followed him, a constant reminder of his sins and his descent into darkness. He seeks a way to silence them once and for all, determined to atone for his past and find redemption in the eyes of the divine.

The Amulet of Celestial Light is both a relic of his noble past and a potential key to silencing the sinister whispers that torment him. He believes that unlocking its secrets may offer him a chance at redemption and freedom from the darkness that consumes him. But he knows that the path to redemption will not be easy, and he must confront the shadows of his past if he is to find the light once more.
